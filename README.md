# VERILOG / VLSI PROJECTS

This repository contains a collection of digital design and VLSI projects
implemented using Verilog / SystemVerilog HDL.

The projects focus on fundamental and advanced concepts in digital design,
including finite state machines (FSM), timing, control logic, and hardware
verification using testbenches.

## Project Categories
- Finite State Machine (FSM) designs
- Communication protocol controllers
- Digital logic modules
- Verification using testbenches
- Timing and control-oriented designs

## Projects Included
- PS/2 Keyboard Scan Code to ASCII Converter (FSM-based)

## Tools & Technologies
- Verilog / SystemVerilog
- EDA Playground
